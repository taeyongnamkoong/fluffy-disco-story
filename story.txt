This is the story of a man called Eric Jensen 
He loved BSTS so much 
He also taught me how to use GitHub
Nice!
A second man named Sean, saw this and thought "how the heck can I possibly add onto 'nice'".
YEEEEHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW he shrieked for he was confused.
Is this a diary or a story?
It probably doesn't matter... 
Actually it does matter, the story of Eric Jensen must live on.
He singlehandly saved the world from an asteroid attack.
This is seriously the end of this story. I got free bananas for the team!
